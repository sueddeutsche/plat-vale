# Plat-Vale

This repository contains the platform Styles and Settings. To use it with vale, configure the `.vale.ini` in in your root directory like this:

```
StylesPath = .vale/styles

; This will synchronize on changes with the remote package "RedHat". As we have that package already checked in and made some modifications, this is commented out
Packages = https://github.com/sueddeutsche/plat-vale/releases/download/v8/plat-vale.zip
```
